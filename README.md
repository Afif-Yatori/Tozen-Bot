# Tozen-Bot
These files represent my discord bot aka Tozen which was made for my semester 2 project in college.
The sqlgame file is the file with all sql related commands.
The game file is the file with all game related commands , as in a game that could work without discord if needed (gotta tweak some things but yeah)
The discordgame2 file is the file with all related commands to discord, it's this file that you are supposed to run to make the bot work.


At the end of the discordgame2 file appears a line that is the most important of the entire code. It's the line in which you input your discord bot token so that it activates the bot.
To get a discord bot token , you need to have a discord account and go to the developpers page https://discord.com/developers/applications
There you can choose to create a bot, invite it to your server and then take its token and put it in the code!
